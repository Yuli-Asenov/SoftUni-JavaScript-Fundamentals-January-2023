//In JavaScript, the ... (spread syntax) is used to expand an iterable (e.g. an array or a string) into individual elements. 
//It can be used in several ways, depending on the context:

//To pass an array as arguments to a function:
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(...arr); // prints "1 2 3"

//To concatenate arrays:
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
let arr3 = [...arr1, ...arr2];
console.log(arr3); // prints "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"

//To create a copy of an array:
let arr4 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr5 = [...arr1];
console.log(arr2); // prints "[1, 2, 3]"


//n the storeGrades function, the ...gradesList syntax is used in two places:
//When splitting the input string into name and gradesList:
let [name, ...gradesList] = d.split(" ");

// Here, the ...gradesList syntax captures all the elements in the d.split(" ") 
// array after the first element (which is assigned to name) and puts them into a new array called gradesList.
// When concatenating the existing grades with the new grades:
grades[name] = [...grades[name], ...gradesList];

// Here, the ...grades[name] syntax expands the existing grades for the current student into individual elements, 
// and the ...gradesList syntax expands the new grades into individual elements. 
// The two arrays are then concatenated using the spread syntax to create 
// a new array containing all the grades for the current student.
// In both cases, the ... syntax is used to convert an array-like object (e.g. a string or an array) into a regular array, 
// so that it can be used with array methods or combined with other arrays.
